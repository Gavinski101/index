	In YT video: Universal Pick and Place Controller! (at 9:49 in the video)he mentions he didn't bother implementing 
	his custom communication protocal(RING) between the controller and the feeders in MARLIN because he is switching 
	to RS45 in anyway in the next motherboard. So we will probably need to wait for the new motherboard in any ways 
	and ditch the (RAMPS kit+ Piggyback) combo. We will have to wait because otherwise we will have to complete his 
	communication protocal in the firmware for him.
	
	So we can get the following so long:
	BOMs(/My Catagories/BOMs/): External parts(RAMPS KIT NO LONGER NECESSARY BUT NICE TO HAVE)
	
	
	That will mean the things to order will be the following IN THE FUTURE:
	BOMs(/My Catagories/BOMs/): PCB assemblies parts(Feeders+ NEW CUSTOM MAINBOARD)
	Custom PCBs(/My Catagories/PCBs): Feeder_Floor, Feeder_IndexingWheel, Feeder_Mobo, NEW CUSTOM MAINBOARD and RingLight
