	In YT video: Universal Pick and Place Controller! he mentions he didn't bother implementing his custom communication protocal(RING) between the controller and the feeders         in MARLIN becasue he is switching to RS45 in anyway in the next motherboard, so we will probably need to wait for the new motherboard in any ways and ditch the (RAMPS kit         + Piggyback) combo. 
	
	That will mean the things to order will be the following IN THE FUTURE:
	BOMs(/My Catagories/BOMs/): External parts(RAMPS KIT NO LONGER NECESSARY BUT NICE TO HAVE), PCB assemblies parts(Feeders+ NEW CUSTOM MAINBOARD)
	Custom PCBs(/My Catagories/PCBs): Feeder_Floor, Feeder_IndexingWheel, Feeder_Mobo, NEW CUSTOM MAINBOARD and RingLight
